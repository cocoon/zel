//! Request context providing access to connection metadata and extensions.
//!
//! [`RequestContext`] is passed to all service handlers and provides access to:
//! - The underlying Iroh connection
//! - Connection type monitoring (direct vs relay)
//! - Three-tier extension system (server/connection/request)
//! - Remote peer information
//! - Graceful shutdown notifications
//!
//! See [`RequestContext`] for usage examples.

///
/// RequestContext provides access to connection metadata and three tiers of extensions:
/// - Server extensions: Shared across all connections
/// - Connection extensions: Scoped to a single connection
/// - Request extensions: Unique per request
///
/// Additionally, handlers can monitor for graceful shutdown notifications to
/// cleanly exit loops, flush pending data, and release resources.
///
/// This allows handlers to access shared resources (like database pools),
/// connection-specific state (like authentication sessions), and request-specific
/// data (like trace IDs).
